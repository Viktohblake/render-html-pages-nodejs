      <p>
        My Name is Victor Onoja, a Mobile App Developer studying Computer<br />
        Science in Federal University of Technology, this field of study is<br />
        something I'm really interested in. As a kid I've been always curious<br />
        about computers and how they work, I'm learning and building up my<br />
        programming skill also with the help of Zuri Program I'm currently<br />
        learning Node Js and it has been amazing so far.<br />
